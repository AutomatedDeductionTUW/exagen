Some issues we encountered with too strict restrictions
while working on Sect.~\ref{sec:sat}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        the sample space might be empty.
        may lead to the generator getting ``stuck'' for a minute until the user kills it.

        For example, a note about restriction~\ref{item:polarity}:
        with all the other restrictions,
        it is impossible to get a formula that contains atomic proposition
        of purely positive and purely negative polarity at the same time.

    \item
        Less drastic but perhaps more problematic:
        the sample space may be restricted too much,
        leading to the generation of boring and similar formulas.

        happens, for example, if we restrict the number of models to exactly one,
        or to no model.

        there simply aren't that many ways to rule out 8 interpretations
        using only 7 connectives.
\end{itemize}
