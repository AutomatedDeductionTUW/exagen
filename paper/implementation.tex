Our implementation consists of various programs that are tied together by a control script.
The control script calls all problem generators
and compiles the exam sheets, resulting in $n$ different exams in PDF format.

The exam sheet template is a \LaTeX{} file
where the concrete formulas and signatures
have been replaced by ``\textbackslash{}input'' commands.



Problem templates: (todo: describe impl of smt and groundsup)



For the full random generation of the SAT and redundancy problems,
we were inspired by Haskell's QuickCheck library,

which we used for the first prototype.

However, because of our many filtering criteria we wanted to have backtracking in the generator.
To this end, we created an mtl-style typeclass \texttt{MonadChoose} with a primitive operation \texttt{choose} for choosing an element from a list of choices.
Our generator implementations are generic over the monad, constrained by this typeclass.

We used two concrete implementations to evaluate generators:
1. 'RandomChoiceT', a monad transformer that implements 'choose' as uniform random choice with backtracking support
    (can be thought of as 'ListT' where 'choose' is like the normal monadic bind but shuffles the list with a random permutation first).
    This is what we actually use to generate random exams.
2. a standard list monad (or similar) to enumerate the sample space.
    This second evaluation method lets us ensure that the sample space is sufficiently large.

% Thus, re-implemented nondeterministic monad with an additional primitive operation for uniform random choice of an element from a list.
% We used mtl-style typeclass for the generator implementations;
% this allows us to use the same generator in two ways.
% 1. get a random element (by evaluating in a 
% 2. list all possible elements (by evaluating in the built-in list monad, or a similar one)
% The second evaluation method lets us ensure that the sample space is sufficiently large.
