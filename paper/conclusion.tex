We describe a randomized approach and toolchain for generating exam problems in
automated reasoning, in particular in the setting of SAT, SMT, and first-order theorem
proving. Our approach was used to generate individual exam sheets focused on
problem solving within automated deduction, and could be adapted to other
constraints and course frameworks.
