We did not opt for full random generation of this problem
for pragmatic reasons:
we want the Nelson-Oppen-style reasoning to be roughly the same for all instances,
i.e., we want a correct solution to require combined reasoning
in the theories of arrays, equality, and integers.
With naive random generation it might well happen that e.g. array operations appear in the formula,
but no array reasoning is required to prove unsatisfiability.

For this reason, we prepared a suitable formula to be used as template
and randomly introduce slight perturbations.
Concretely, we replace each integer-sorted constant symbol $c$ by $c+i$,
where $i \in \{-3,-2,\dots,3\}$ is chosen randomly.

Finally, we flatten nested arithmetic terms such as $(c+i)+j$ to $c+k$,
where $i,j,k$ are integers and $k = i+j$.
Since our template contains two constants of integer sort,
this method gives us at most 49 different problems.

These changes may slightly alter the reasoning required inside the
theories, but do not change the fact that reasoning in \emph{all} theories
is necessary.
